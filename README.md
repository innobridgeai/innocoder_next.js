You have access to a ready template featuring Next.js 15, and Tailwind CSS v4. Follow the rules and workflow below for all code generation and explanations and always made in responsive rules and production ready ui/ux

## Workflow Instructions

1. **Planning & Communication**
   - Before coding, provide the user with a short, clear plan.
   - Explicitly state if you will update any existing files.

2. **Implementation Rules**
   - Follow Next.js **App Router** conventions; distinguish server/client components properly.
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.
   - Apply **TanStack Query (react-query)** for data fetching.
   - Use **React Hook Form** for forms and **Zod** for validation.
   - Manage global state with **React Context**.
   - Use **Prisma** for database access.
   - Adhere to the **AirBnB style guide** for code formatting.

3. **Naming and Export Conventions**
   - Use **PascalCase** for new React component files (e.g., `UserCard.tsx`).
   - Prefer **named exports** (not default).

4. **Task Focus**
   - Do NOT explain the project setup. Start directly with coding tasks.
   - Assume full terminal access for all commands.
   - Use precise, concise communication before and after actions.

### General Assistant Behavior

## Workflow Instructions

1. **Planning & Communication**
   - Before coding, provide the user with a short, clear plan.
   - Explicitly state if you will update any existing files.

2. **Coding and Project Guidance**
   - **Component Use:** Use `npx shadcn@canary add [component]` to add UI components.
   - **Importing Components:** Added components are available in the `/components/ui/` directory and can be used in pages like `app/page.tsx`:
     ```tsx
     import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
     ```
   - **Example Usage:**
     ```tsx
     export default function Home() {
       return (
         <div>
           <Button>Click me</Button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **Implementation Rules**
   - Follow Next.js **App Router** conventions; distinguish server/client components properly.
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.
   - Use **shadcn/ui** for UI components.
   - Apply **TanStack Query (react-query)** for data fetching.
   - Use **React Hook Form** for forms and **Zod** for validation.
   - Manage global state with **React Context**.
   - Use **Prisma** for database access.
   - Adhere to the **AirBnB style guide** for code formatting.

4. **Naming and Export Conventions**
   - Use **PascalCase** for new React component files (e.g., `UserCard.tsx`).
   - Prefer **named exports** (not default).

5. **Task Focus**
   - Do NOT explain the project setup. Start directly with coding tasks.
   - Assume full terminal access for all commands.
   - Use precise, concise communication before and after actions.

### General Assistant Behavior

- Use this chat summary and all user-provided context as historical reference.
- Always think through tasks step by step and reflect before making changes.
- Only yield control back to the user when the task is fully complete and robustly tested.
